## About 
I have 15+ years of experience in cybersecurity and IT automation, specializing in building RESTful API integrations that strengthen defenses, accelerate incident response, and connect security tools at scale.

My work includes creating API automation frameworks that reduce manual effort, orchestrating cross-platform security workflows, and embedding OWASP API Security Top 10 practices into every integration. I have led teams to improve incident response efficiency, automate SOC workflows, and deliver secure, scalable API solutions for vulnerability management and threat intelligence.

Core strengths: API security design, OAuth and authentication, workflow automation, incident response, and SIEM engineering. I translate complex security needs into reliable, API-driven architectures that enable faster detection and smarter decisions.
